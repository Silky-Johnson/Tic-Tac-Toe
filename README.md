# TIC TAC TOE
---

Tic Tac Toe is a simple game played between two players
that 'race' to be the first to make three in a row in a
3x3 grid.

First, a player must choose either 'X' or 'O as their piece.
Whoever chooses 'X' will be the first player of the game.

Second, the player will choose a spot. For example:

1 1 will be

. . .
. X .
. . .

The opponent (the board) will attempt to choose a spot to either
block the player from connecting three, or to further their
interest and connect a three of their own.

It's a quick little game! Have fun!

## TO RUN
What you currently have is just the .cpp file. To create an executable
just run

`g++ game.cpp`

This will create a .out file, that you can then run as your executable like
this:

`./a.out`

If you would like to change that name during compilation, do something similar to
this:

`g++ -o game game.cpp`

and it will create an executable named "game".

Enjoy!
